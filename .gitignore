## Memento Design Pattern

* A way to store previous states of an Object easily.
* **Memento**: The basic object that is stored in different states.
* **Originator**: Sets and Gets values from the currently targeted Memento. Creates new Mementos and assigns current values to them.
* **Caretaker**: Holds an ArrayList that contains all previous versions of the Memento. It can store and retrieve stored Mementos.
